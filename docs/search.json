These products also include ecosystem dynamic models that can be used for conservation, fire planning, and land management decisions.\nLANDFIRE’s mission is to provide agency leaders and managers with a common “all-lands” data set of vegetation and wildland fire/fuels information for strategic fire and resource management planning and analysis.\n\n “Advancing conservation outcomes through collaborative ecosystem science”"

For example, if you over over the dark green outer band of the “Past Conifer” group you can see that some is now mapped as converted, some hardwood, etc., and that the majority is still mapped as conifer.\nAlternatively, if you hover over the orange outer band of “Hardwood” you can see what the present extent of hardwoods vegetation was historically.\nThe popups contain acres for the band."
